## Workflow and contributions
https://github.com/CasperDash/casperdash-client/wiki/Development-Workflow

## Guidelines for development

We use:
- `yarn` to manage packages
- `typescript` to develop the library
- `jest` (ts-jest) to write and run tests
- `esbuild` to build the library to different targets

## Usage commands

- `yarn test` to run tests
- `yarn build` to compile typescript to javascript with declarations
- `yarn esbuild` to build the library to other targets (browser)
- `yarn lint` to ensure coding standards
